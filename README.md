# Response to Two Database News Articles
In this paper, I will discuss two different events about the benefits and drawbacks that databases have brought to people's lives. I will present two opposing viewpoints and personal opinions about the development of databases regarding this important event.

## **Article 1**: UK Bus Open Data Service for People's Journeys
[The link text you see on the web page](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/05/three_years_after_it_set/)  In a significant step towards improving the accessibility and efficiency of public transport, the UK Department for Transport has committed to awarding a contract worth **Â£24 million** to a technology company to build a comprehensive data service for local bus transport. It aims to use high-quality, accurate, and open data to provide passengers with valuable information to plan journeys, find cost-effective tickets, and access real-time service updates across England. This highly anticipated Transit Open Data Service _BODS_ project has been underway for over three years to make vital transit service information available as open data.

The strategic use of data has **great potential to enhance the attractiveness** of local buses to travelers. By providing easy access to up-to-date data on routes, timetables, fares, tickets, and vehicle locations, DfT aims to create a more seamless and efficient mobility ecosystem. The ultimate vision is for a faster, cheaper, cleaner, more responsive, and safer transport system enabled by open data that everyone can access. Given that local buses account for the vast majority of public transport trips in England, this initiative could significantly **improve the overall quality** of transport services.

## **Article 2**: Pakistan's National Database Encodes Social Expectations
In contrast to the bus open data service, Pakistan's experience creating a kinship-coded database reveals essential lessons about the complexities of building digital identity systems.[The link text you see on the web page](https://www.wired.com/story/pakistan-digital-database-family-design/)  This article explores the complexity of digital identity systems through the lens of the case of Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority _NADRA_. It reveals how _NADRA's_ digital ID system has become a central element in the lives of Pakistani citizens, influencing access to services and opportunities while embedding certain social expectations and judgments in its database design.

The digital ID system in Pakistan is rooted in historical, social, and political contexts. The database requires individuals to be authenticated through family structures, which encode social norms about family, gender, and relationships. For example, it assumes that children can only be born in heterosexual marriages, which creates challenges for individuals who do not meet these normative standards. This paper raises important questions about the future of the global digital identity system. As countries increasingly adopt biometric databases for identification, more flexible and imaginative system architectures are needed to accommodate changing social norms and diverse identities. In addition, it emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, with computer scientists and engineers working alongside sociologists, anthropologists, and other experts to ensure that technological choices in database design consider broader social and political implications. Even seemingly banal technical decisions can have far-reaching social implications, and **thoughtful, inclusive** design is critical to shaping the future of digital identity systems.
